This project segments customers based on their income and expense percentage using K-Means clustering. The model is deployed via a Flask application and hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) App Engine.

##### Details of Cluster and Customer Behavior:
1. High Income Low Spend - Prospective customer for buisness growth
2. High Income High Spend - No special attention required
3. Moderate Income Moderate Spend - No special attention required
4. Low Income Low Spend - Low chances of buisness
5. Low Income High Spend - Risk to buisness

##### Steps to Run
1. Open CMD and go to project path
2. Download GoogleCloudSDKInstaller
3. Initialize by entering the command on CMD : *gcloud init*
4. Select Email ID, Project Name and Area
